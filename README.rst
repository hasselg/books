Description
============
Books is a small web application designed for allowing an individual to keep track the books they have read.

Dependencies
============
The following dependencies are required for running *books*:

* CherryPy (http://www.cherrypy.org) (tested on v3.2.4)
* Django (http://www.djangoproject.com) (tested on v1.5.1)

If your Python installation cannot import the respective modules, then *books* will not be able to run correctly.

Execution
============
*books* is executed by running books.py. You may then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/books/library/. Alternatively, you may choose to install and use the books-viewer application, available at https://github.com/hasselg/books-viewer.
